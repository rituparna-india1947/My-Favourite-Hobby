      I love to Dance because it has two advantages- 1. For Enjoyment and 2. For Physical Exercise. It also keeps our mind fresh and keeps us healthy too. There are a lot of Dance types and we can learn the steps and perform it in front of everyone wherever we want like in some functions and programmes instantly. We can have our own natural basic steps which is created by us and apply it every time in our dances. We can even do expeeriments with Dance, for e.g. we can play any recent bollywood song and do a traditional dance, it will be humerous and fun for us. These all reasons sum up Dance as my favourite hobby.
